# JITLang
A Just In Time compiled language that aims to be JavaScript the way JavaScript should have been designed.
The language combines features from lower level languages and higher level languages together to get a hybrid language.

Notes:
  - The language is FAR from being complete. It's just barely a usable language at the moment.
  - The language is theoretically capabable of being faster than JavaScript, however at the moment my runtime is about 10,000x slower.
  - I implemented it's runtime in JavaScript which happens to be very very slow, but in the future I will rewrite VexScript's runtime in C++ which should make it much more performant.
